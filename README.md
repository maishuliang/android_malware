# android_malware
senior capstone project

I am working on NLP technics to extract API calls on the android apps and using SVM to classify if an android app is a malware.


## Finished Part
### Data Ingestion
1. Automatically download the apk file(android app) from Android market
2. Automatically decompile the apk files to Smali code.

### Feacture Extraction & EDA
3. Build the graph by applying NLP on the Smali files, form thousand of API calls
4. Apply EDA and build the Baseline model by puttting in the basic features like total different classes of API calls, total packages, etc.

## Goals
5. Using the graphs to build more complicated and higher accuracy models.
6. Apply node2vect and Deep learning technics.

7. More development for next quarter...
